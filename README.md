The N-Queen Simulation Project is a classic algorithmic problem brought to life through an interactive web-based visualization. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project allows users to understand and explore how the N-Queen problem is solved through backtracking or other algorithmic techniques.

In the N-Queen problem, the goal is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. That means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. This problem is widely used to teach recursion, backtracking, and optimization strategies in computer science.

The project provides a visual simulation, where users can:

* Select the board size (value of N)

* Start/step through the algorithm to see how queens are placed and conflicts are resolved

* Watch the backtracking process in action when a placement fails
